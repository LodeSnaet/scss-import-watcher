# ‚ö°Ô∏è SCSS Import Watcher
A powerful and intuitive command-line interface tool designed to automate the management of your SCSS `@import` statements. Say goodbye to manually adding or removing imports as your project structure evolves!
This tool is particularly helpful for projects utilizing SCSS partials alongside modern build tools like Vite, Webpack, or Rollup, which often rely on a single entry point for your SCSS.

## ‚ú® Features

This CLI simplifies your SCSS workflow by automatically generating and maintaining `@import` statements in your main SCSS file(s) based on the contents of your watched directories.

* **Interactive Setup**: A user-friendly command-line interface guides you through the setup process.
* **Project Root Definition**: Define a central root directory for your SCSS project.
* **Flexible Watcher Creation**:
  * Create **watchers** for any subfolder within your project root.
  * Specify a **single SCSS file at the root level** (e.g., `main.scss`, `styles.scss`) where all generated `@import` statements will be placed.
  * **Intelligent Import Management**: Automatically generates and updates `@import` statements for all `.scss` files found within your watched directories.
* **Custom Marker Support**: Users can define their own custom start and end marker comments in the target SCSS file. The CLI will detect and utilize these user-defined markers to manage `@import` statements, ensuring they stay in their desired location.
    * **Marker Syntax**: These markers must be valid SCSS comments. Each pair of start and end markers is directly associated with a specific **watcher's folder**. They must follow this exact format:
        ```scss
        /* [FOLDER_NAME] import start */
        @import 'example';
        /* [[FOLDER_NAME] import end */
        ```
      Ensure these marker pairs are unique in your file to avoid conflicts.
* **Automatic Partial Naming**: When generating `@import` statements, the CLI automatically removes the leading underscore from SCSS partial filenames (e.g., `_variables.scss` becomes `@import "variables";`).
* **Nested Watcher Exclusions**: Automatically configures exclusions so that nested watchers don't duplicate imports from their parent watchers.
* **Watcher Management Dashboard**:
  * **View All Watchers**: Get a clear list of all your active watchers, showing their watched folder and target SCSS file.
  * **Edit Watchers**: Modify an existing watcher's watched folder, target SCSS file, or even its name. The system handles cleanup and relocation of imports accordingly.
  * **Delete Watchers**: Remove individual watchers or delete all of them. When deleting a watcher, its markers are removed, and imports are left as "floating" (to be cleaned up manually if a new watcher claims them).
* **Clean Exit**: Ensures all watchers are gracefully shut down and their markers are removed when you exit the CLI. Generated import statements stay in place.
* **Visual Cues**: Uses simple text-based icons (üìÅ, üìÑ, ‚Ü©Ô∏è) in interactive prompts to enhance readability and navigation.

## üö´ Limitations

While powerful, this tool has a few limitations to be aware of:

* **No SCSS Compilation**: This tool **does not compile your SCSS** into CSS. You'll need a separate SCSS compiler (like Node-Sass, Dart Sass, or a build tool like Webpack/Gulp) for that.
* **Directory Watching Only**: Watchers monitor entire directories for `.scss` files; they do not target individual files for specific content.
* **Root-Level Styles File**: The target SCSS file where imports are written **must reside directly in the root directory you define when starting the CLI** (i.e., the "Project Root" you select in the initial prompt). It cannot be in a subfolder of *that* selected root.
* **Text-Based UI**: The CLI uses basic console prompts. It does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI) or rich visual elements beyond standard Unicode characters.
* **SCSS `@import` Specific**: It specifically manages `@import` statements for SCSS files and does not handle other types of CSS `@import` or `@use` rules outside of its scope.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

* **Floating Imports After Deletion**: When a watcher is deleted, its specific marker comments are removed, but the generated `@import` statements themselves are retained (they become "floating" imports).
  * If these floating imports are then managed by a **newly created or existing watcher** for the *same content* (e.g., you create a new watcher for the exact same folder), the CLI will not automatically re-home them within the new watcher's markers, be mindful for duplicates.

## üöÄ Getting Started & Usage

#### 1. Project-Specific Installation (Recommended for Project Use)

This method installs the CLI as a development dependency within your project, allowing it to be managed via `npm scripts`. This is ideal for project-specific automation and ensures consistent versions across your team.

1.  **Install the package in your project:**
    Navigate to your project's root directory and install it as a dev dependency:
    ```bash
      npm i -D scss-import-watcher
    ```
    
2.  **Add a script to your project's `package.json`:**
    Open your project's `package.json` file and add an entry to the `"scripts"` section to easily run the CLI. I recommend using `npx` to ensure the locally installed version is executed.

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "watch-scss": "npx scss-watcher"
    }
    ```
    Remember to use the command name (`scss-watcher`) that you defined in the `bin` field of the `scss-import-watcher-cli` package's `package.json`.

3.  **Run the CLI from your project root:**
    ```bash
    npm run watch-scss
    ```
