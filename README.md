# ‚ö°Ô∏è SCSS Import Watcher CLI

A powerful and intuitive command-line interface tool designed to automate the management of your SCSS `@import` statements. Say goodbye to manually adding or removing imports as your project structure evolves!

---

## ‚ú® Features

This CLI simplifies your SCSS workflow by automatically generating and maintaining `@import` statements in your main SCSS file(s) based on the contents of your watched directories.

* **Interactive Setup**: A user-friendly command-line interface guides you through the setup process.
* **Project Root Definition**: Define a central root directory for your SCSS project.
* **Flexible Watcher Creation**:
    * Create **watchers** for any subfolder within your project root.
    * Specify a **single SCSS file at the root level** (e.g., `main.scss`, `styles.scss`) where all generated `@import` statements will be placed.
    * **Intelligent Import Management**: Automatically generates and updates `@import` statements for all `.scss` files found within your watched directories.
    * **Duplicate Prevention**: Smartly detects and removes redundant `@import` statements, ensuring your main SCSS file remains clean and efficient. If you stop a watcher and its imports become "floating," they'll be automatically "re-homed" or removed if a new watcher claims them.
* **Nested Watcher Exclusions**: Automatically configures exclusions so that nested watchers don't duplicate imports from their parent watchers.
* **Watcher Management Dashboard**:
    * **View All Watchers**: Get a clear list of all your active watchers, showing their watched folder and target SCSS file.
    * **Edit Watchers**: Modify an existing watcher's watched folder, target SCSS file, or even its name. The system handles cleanup and relocation of imports accordingly.
    * **Delete Watchers**: Remove individual watchers or delete all of them. When deleting a watcher, its markers are removed, and imports are left as "floating" (to be cleaned up if a new watcher claims them).
* **Clean Exit**: Ensures all watchers are gracefully shut down and their managed imports are removed (fully or partially, based on configuration) when you exit the CLI.
* **Visual Cues**: Uses simple text-based icons (üìÅ, üìÑ, ‚Ü©Ô∏è) in interactive prompts to enhance readability and navigation.

## üö´ Limitations

While powerful, this tool has a few limitations to be aware of:

* **No SCSS Compilation**: This tool **does not compile your SCSS** into CSS. You'll need a separate SCSS compiler (like Node-Sass, Dart Sass, or a build tool like Webpack/Gulp) for that.
* **Directory Watching Only**: Watchers monitor entire directories for `.scss` files; they do not target individual files for specific content.
* **Root-Level Styles File**: The target SCSS file where imports are written (`stylesFile`) **must reside directly in your project's root directory**. It cannot be in a subfolder.
* **Text-Based UI**: The CLI uses basic console prompts. It does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI) or rich visual elements beyond standard Unicode characters.
* **SCSS `@import` Specific**: It specifically manages `@import` statements for SCSS files and does not handle other types of CSS `@import` or `@use` rules outside of its scope.
