# ‚ö°Ô∏è SCSS Import Watcher CLI

A powerful and intuitive command-line interface tool designed to automate the management of your SCSS `@import` statements. Say goodbye to manually adding or removing imports as your project structure evolves!

---

## ‚ú® Features

This CLI simplifies your SCSS workflow by automatically generating and maintaining `@import` statements in your main SCSS file(s) based on the contents of your watched directories.

* **Interactive Setup**: A user-friendly command-line interface guides you through the setup process.
* **Project Root Definition**: Define a central root directory for your SCSS project.
* **Flexible Watcher Creation**:
  * Create **watchers** for any subfolder within your project root.
  * Specify a **single SCSS file at the root level** (e.g., `main.scss`, `styles.scss`) where all generated `@import` statements will be placed.
  * **Intelligent Import Management**: Automatically generates and updates `@import` statements for all `.scss` files found within your watched directories.
  * **Duplicate Prevention**: Smartly detects and removes redundant `@import` statements, ensuring your main SCSS file remains clean and efficient. If you stop a watcher and its imports become "floating," they'll be automatically "re-homed" or removed if a new watcher claims them.
* **Nested Watcher Exclusions**: Automatically configures exclusions so that nested watchers don't duplicate imports from their parent watchers.
* **Watcher Management Dashboard**:
  * **View All Watchers**: Get a clear list of all your active watchers, showing their watched folder and target SCSS file.
  * **Edit Watchers**: Modify an existing watcher's watched folder, target SCSS file, or even its name. The system handles cleanup and relocation of imports accordingly.
  * **Delete Watchers**: Remove individual watchers or delete all of them. When deleting a watcher, its markers are removed, and imports are left as "floating" (to be cleaned up if a new watcher claims them).
* **Clean Exit**: Ensures all watchers are gracefully shut down and their managed imports are removed (fully or partially, based on configuration) when you exit the CLI.
* **Visual Cues**: Uses simple text-based icons (üìÅ, üìÑ, ‚Ü©Ô∏è) in interactive prompts to enhance readability and navigation.

## üö´ Limitations

While powerful, this tool has a few limitations to be aware of:

* **No SCSS Compilation**: This tool **does not compile your SCSS** into CSS. You'll need a separate SCSS compiler (like Node-Sass, Dart Sass, or a build tool like Webpack/Gulp) for that.
* **Directory Watching Only**: Watchers monitor entire directories for `.scss` files; they do not target individual files for specific content.
* **Root-Level Styles File**: The target SCSS file where imports are written (`stylesFile`) **must reside directly in your project's root directory**. It cannot be in a subfolder.
* **Text-Based UI**: The CLI uses basic console prompts. It does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI) or rich visual elements beyond standard Unicode characters.
* **SCSS `@import` Specific**: It specifically manages `@import` statements for SCSS files and does not handle other types of CSS `@import` or `@use` rules outside of its scope.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

* **Floating Imports After Deletion**: When a watcher is deleted, its specific marker comments are removed, but the generated `@import` statements themselves are retained (they become "floating" imports).
  * If these floating imports are then managed by a **newly created or existing watcher** for the *same content* (e.g., you create a new watcher for the exact same folder), the CLI will not automatically re-home them within the new watcher's markers, be mindful for dublicates.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use this CLI, you'll need Node.js installed on your system.

### Installation

You can install this package globally using npm, which allows you to run it as a command from any directory:

```bash
npm i scss-import-watcher
```

Follow the interactive prompts:

* **Set your Project Root**: Define the base directory of your SCSS project.
* **Main Menu**: Choose from options like:
  * **‚ûï Create new watcher**: Define a folder to watch and the root-level SCSS file for its imports.
  * **üëÄ Show watchers**: View a list of all active watchers, and select one to edit or delete it.
  * **üóëÔ∏è Delete watcher(s)**: Stop and remove one or more watchers.
  * **üö™ Exit**: Close the CLI.
